		<h2>The Multi-core: One Application Per Core Approach to Programming the ADSP-BF609</h2>

		<p>
		You have created a project that uses the multi-core, one application per core programming 
		model for the ADSP-BF609 processor. In this approach, each core is treated as a
		separate processor, and each project is built individually. Effectively, multiple
		single-core applications are built independently, and run in parallel on the
		processor. The shared memory areas, both internal and external, are left to the
		developer to arrange for shared, serializable access from each of the cores.
		</p>

		<p>
		If you selected the 'Add template code to the application' option in the
		Project Wizard, your project will contain template code to help you get
		started, including a 'main' function for all the cores. If you did not
		select the option, you will need to declare your own 'main' functions. A 'main'
		function must be declared for all the cores.
		</p>

		<p>
		To get started with your application, begin adding your source code to the
		'main' function in all the projects. If you are defining your own, you must
		include a call to the adi_core_enable function in your core 0 project.
		This function allows core 0 to enable core 1, and is declared in adi_core.h.
		If you selected the 'Add template code to the application' option this function call
		is automatically added to your 'main' functions in each project.
		</p>
